## TPU Shoes - availability, pitch, feasibility

[Elegoo TPU is available at 2k!](https://www.amazon.in/Filament-Flexible-Printing-Dimensional-Accuracy/dp/B0FCFG362W?crid=3JCOJ4LAS6YTF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.F8SUaBOvA2TySHmx-YsjapKKnZuFKKqbyDk_NN2htAShbysKyjDpfpDVpXmGJFUdU8iPGU9qfZjzOg4ruBDN4hSrqu53-6m7iS3OPna1PeE1-46U43mkwQFl21SXUkLdNIToFlNdIjcV4whdktNJQw-r7scA_5BNkuId3KaBpWHS-PoRRnSYsJx7w9pl-hxlw0Xow_Ll1YkB2bYS9WH_ouqnBenMPfYqzOCEQHUtYtFlTGna_fvifuEIRLgVVSlCQwktp6lHrWWt3aCGfWSwTe7RVi06akfAAsf5G3Kh8Eo.QTirkNOTWlZw0XWOxuU5aIb8iumPeCOLxCx82B9Tqxg&dib_tag=se&keywords=tpu&qid=1760543302&sprefix=t%2Caps%2C352&sr=8-4&th=1)
TPU is surprisingly cheap. This one is advertised as 95A(?).
For comparison, the PolyTerra PLA that I favour, I usually buy at 1.5k.

The print temperatures are very similar to PLA  200-230Â°C. **NO SMOOTH PEI PLATE!!!**
Speeds 30-80 mm/s. Direct drive. All very doable.

TPU requires having a filament dryer. Very hygroscopic. Costs from 7k-12k. Did not search extensively(!).
