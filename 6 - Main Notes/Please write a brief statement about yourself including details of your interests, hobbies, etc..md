### V1
I am an avid painter, and was a part of the Dept. of Art, Design and Publicity in my college. We worked on 15-20 ft high murals and campus beautification through artworks and sculptures during fests. I also have worked as a
DevOps engineer, which has taught me to think big-picture of systems, automation and scalability. 
When I acquired a 3D printer, a whole new world opened up to me. I started off using the printer just as a tool to make trinkets, toys and later utility items using PLA. I have also combined my training in electronics with this to create cases for my micro-controllers, RC cars and later, a home theatre system. 
I took my first steps into entrepreneurship when I started making merchandise for my friend's coffee shop. I am also researching on the viability of using exotic materials like TPU to print daily use objects, specifically shoes. Researching viable products, modelling, customizing and then printing them reliably and consistently, has exposed many of my current shortcomings with both theory and practice.

I also learned of using TPU to make daily use objects and was blown away to learn that 3D printed shoes are being researched currently. Researching viable products, modelling, customizing and then printing them reliably and consistently exposed many of my current shortcomings with both theory and practice.

I am an avid painter and was part of the Dept. of Art, Design and Publicity in my college, where we created murals and did campus beautification through artworks and sculpture during fests.
My experience as a DevOps engineer has taught me to think big-picture, in terms of systems, scalability and automation.
When I acquired a 3D printer, a new world opened up to me. What began as trinkets in PLA later grew into cases for my micro-controllers, an RC car and eventually a home-theatre system. Combining my desire for creation with my training in electronics has given me the greatest joy to date.
I have also tried my hand at entrepreneurship by making merchandise for a friend's coffee shop. My most recent interest has been exploring the use of exotic materials like TPU to print everyday products like shoes. This process has shown me where I need to bridge the gaps between theory and practice.
