### V1
I have experience working as a DevOps engineer, which has taught me to think big-picture of systems, automation and scalability. When I was gifted a 3D printer, a whole new world was opened up for me. I started off using the printer just as a tool to make trinkets, toys and later utility items using PLA. I also started combining my training in electronics with my hobby to create a home theatre system for myself.  I took my first steps into entrepreneurship when I started making merchandise for my friend's coffee shop. I also learned of using TPU to make daily use objects and was blown away to learn that 3D printed shoes are being researched currently. Researching viable products, modelling, customizing and then printing them reliably and consistently exposed many of my current shortcomings with both theory and practice.
I am also an avid painter, and was a part of the Dept. of Art, Design and Publicity in my college. We worked on 15-20 ft high murals and campus beautification during fests.
