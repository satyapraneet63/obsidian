## What can dreams reveal?

I am in a non-descript time and place. Contemporary India. Diverse multi-ethnic people around me. All Indian.
I am in front of an enclave. A building with many businesses in it. Everything. Also has residential for lower-middle class in it.
I am here on a task. Not very important not something to be ignored. Something I came here to do. So I will.
The building goes from seedy to posh with its height.

At the bottom, is a drug bar. A bar, but for drugs. People coming in, going out, doing their thing. No one minds me walking through. No one minds me staring at them. I feel envious. Not with the drugs, but the carefree. attitude to life. Enjoying the moment, tattoos.

I walk through. Then pass through some homes. Not fancy, but homely. People of a lower income bracket.

Then I pass through a banquet hall. A marriage is taking place here. South Indian. But modern. Progressive. Attractive. The ladies and gents. Not models, but appealing to my tastes.
I am happy for them. Also a little lonely. The bride and her closest friends greet me. The ceremonies have not started yet. They are socializing.
They know of me. Not know me. Know of me. Apparently our friend group overlaps.
I spend some time there. Very nice ambience. Good food (snacks). Pretty people. Some relatives from abroad, most here in India only.
They remind me of my cousin's relatives who live here. Snooty but not arrogant. Nose in the air, but not looking down at you.

I "socialize" for a while. They are so nice to me. Included me. The boys and girls. We spent time in large groups and one-on-one. It was good. But not once did I feel desire for them. I was thinking of my task at the back of my mind.
The "socializing" felt hollow to me. I was nodding along, smiling, making jokes, greeting people etc. The kind I did at my brother and my cousins' weddings. It went so well. I was pleased. Not that I had spent quality time, but that I had shown skill with handling people. I was not pleasure, but job satisfaction. My heart was closed. I did not let it move, or it did not move, I don't know.
I eventually made my excuses said goodbye to them, gave the bride my heartfelt good wishes and stepped out. I was going above.

Above was a bar. The regular kind. Nice place. Classy. It seemed Goan. To go further, I had to deposit my belongings. Keys, wallet, watch. So I went down to the drug bar.
The people were so chill. I wanted to observe them. Compare myself to them. They did not mind. They were nice to me.
I have never felt an attraction to drugs. I instead feel pity and disgust at the thought. The haze was in the air. Tough to breathe.

I wanted some guidance. People were making merry around me. One man did some synth beside me. Not malicious just careless.
Then my brother showed up. He was kind to me. Gave me advice.
"Such are these places Bobby. Attractive and repulsive. You came for a task - Go get to it" It also felt like this place was nostalgic to him.
He then came out and hopped into a car that my mother was driving. They both drove away then. I chased after them, then turned around and came back to the enclave.

I decided to not store my belongings near the drug bar, but the actual bar.
While passing through the housing I was hearing and following a small family's struggle with the local politics. Not serious, more like nagging.

It was mildly interesting but i do not really care. I moved on. I went to the pan shop near the bar. The man was dressed like a fancy waiter. Nice fellow. Seemed North-eastern or Goan. Allowed me to store my belongings there. Then I went back to the banquet hall.
As I was coming down, I passed by a dance studio where couples were practicing. Beautiful forms. Precise and well timed. Synchronized. Intimate, but not erotic. I was enamoured and started asking around about it. Was it Latin? Spanish? Any other? Got no answers.
I also mentioned the wonderful dance in the wedding party.
Later, I came back up to retrieve my stuff. The man asked to take it myself from above a shelf.

I got up, but as i came down. is a stool i was stepping, on, broke. The bar owner came running to me. Asking for my parents' contacts.
At this point, I realized my stage in the dream. I was a young man, not too young. Had my own money and was proud of it. So I confidently told him, that I would pay fort it and I did. Then I came back down and was moving through the residences again. The family was bickering.
Then apparently the father had a stroke and everyone started panicking. The hallways filled up. So, I decided to take an outside route. I stepped through an open window on to some tin roof or such.

There was some barbed wire and i cut myself unknowingly. The cut was between my elbow and wrist.
Not painful or bloody, but it revealed the muscle.
As I moved my arm around, the cut split and widened, making the slide muscle out.
Did not panic. I never panicked during this sequence. All I would think of was,"Such a shame, I am right-handed." I then came out and started walking across the street to an Apollo "Pharmacology" Not pharmacy, Pharmacology.
The guards outside were shouting that I would find no help there and I should go to a real hospital. There was an Omni Hospital 5-6 buildings away and I started going towards it.

During this time, I started flexing my fingers to make sure I had not lost their function. I did not.
But this action had caused the split to go up my wrist. I had partially degloved my right arm. From palm to elbow.
The pain was starting to hit me, but greater was the tingling and numbness. It was nearly unbearable, the tingling. My dark pink flesh was exposed and there was some blood. Not a lot as no major artery was cut. I was calm during the whole thing. Then walking, i passed out. I woke up. I was on my back and my arm was raised up at 90° with my elbow bent hence the tingling and numbness. This was not a nightmare, my heart was not beating hard.
