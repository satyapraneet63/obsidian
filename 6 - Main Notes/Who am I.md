# Who am I

*Introduce myself - start informal.*

I am a 25 year old guy. Engineer by education, Tinkerer by choice. Graduated in 2021 from BITS Pilani with a degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering.

My interests include painting, 3D printing, homelabbing and hobby electronics projects.

You can find me puttering about my printer on my off days, streaming from my homeserver or writing buggy code on my days-off. I am a hardcore believer in DIY and FOSS.

I also paint. Have a lot of experience with large scale paintings. If you need a mural painted in your office, you know who to contact :wink_face
