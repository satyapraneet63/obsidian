## Cafe Pitch
The two principal founders, Ferdinant and Tosif came and met me at our house today.
They looked over my creations and offered me a role with them in the creative capacity. 
They want to have merchandising associated with the cafe and I can have complete control of it. Includes 3D printed items like dice towers, miniatures, tokens and souvenirs as well as paintings, murals and anything I can think of.
They primarily need me for ideas as well as the feasibility analysis of it. This part will be unpaid as of now. Anything printed/painted/created will be paid for. There will be a written documentation of this.
I am free to use their premises for my purposes including working remote/freelancing completely as long as my obligations are met.
Ferdinant also has an art gallery and says any canvasses I make can be listed in the cafe for view and for sale under his gallery tag.
Their vision of the cafe includes RC cars, robots and board games. So, they are willing to invest in bigger/better printers and filaments alongside me.
Tosif previously worked at T-Hub and asked me to go there and look at possibilities to work/learn there. They have good machines and are willing to help out.

----
##### Pros
* Opportunity to work and showcase my self in an entrepreneurial sense.
* Learn the ins and outs of business and monetization hands-on.
* Contacts and networking.
* Can go to T-Hub and look at help/investment/possibilities over there. (Independent of the café)
* Easy way to get started with using higher-end machines and more exotic filaments.
* Expand my portfolio for future references in resumé
---
##### Opportunity cost
* Time. I will have to commit myself to at least 6 months with them.
* Opportunities for traditional jobs be it in Hyderabad or Bangalore.
* Gap in resumé (already a problem) and losing touch with skills as an IT engineer (also a problem).
* Money. I will not be earning a traditionally good salary and will be spending on experimentation and possibly failed prints.
