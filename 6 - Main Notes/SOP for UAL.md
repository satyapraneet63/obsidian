## SOP for UAL

I see engineering as a process of identifying problems  and building to the solutions through understanding and repetition. I am thus drawn to the MA Industrial Design course at Central Saint Martins for its strategic design practices and emphasis on utilizing emerging technologies to serve human needs. The course's five themes,  enterprise, public, service, discourse, and horizon, all resonate deeply with me. I see the course as the foundation for transitioning from engineering and iteration to holistic design. UAL's collaborative studio environment and real-world client projects will equip me to navigate Industry 5.0 challenges.

I’m particularly drawn to Industrial Design and its potential within Additive Manufacturing. I want to combine my engineering experience with strong design sensibilities, bringing together material science, advanced manufacturing techniques and ergonomics. For example, I am currently taken in by the current developments in 3D-printed shoes  using various grades of TPU, blurring the line between bespoke tailoring, art and technology. I’m intrigued by my own experience on how Additive Manufacturing can transform our relationship with objects. I have learned to look at them as "creations" rather than "products." I want to also explore how the experience of using 3D printers themselves can be improved through material science, motion systems and design.

My professional experience as a DevOps engineer has taught me to thing big-picture in terms of systems and scalability. My study as an Electronics and Instrumentation Engineer has drawn me to Additive Manufacturing as an expression of the fusion of electronics, software, mechanics and artistic expression. I have built my own 3D printer from individual components and modified both hardware and software, even writing its configuration and firmware through Klipper. I have further honed my prototyping skills through iteration on it. My best project has been building a Home Theater using this printer to make all the speaker enclosures and a programmable DSP for the most immersive audio experience possible. Beside my technical work, I am an avid painter and have been a part of the Department of Art, Design and Publicity in my college, where we did campus beautification through large scale murals.

Post graduation, I wish to contribute to R&D in product design firms and consultancies. I believe I can use my engineering foundation alongside strategic design expertise to create accessible, tech-infused products.
Central Saint Martins' global reputation and alumni network will give me a great platform to help develop my ideas from concepts to reality.

My creative practice fuses electronics engineering, software automation, and artistic expression. With a BE in Electronics and Instrumentation, I built a custom 3D printer from scratch, handling mechanical design, firmware configuration via Klipper (open-source on GitHub), and iterative repairs/mods. This project honed my prototyping skills, mirroring industrial design's iterative user-testing cycles. Similarly, I engineered a home theater system using 3D-printed cabinets and a DSP processor programmed in Sigma Studio, optimizing audio for immersive experiences. Complementing this technical work, my background as an avid painter includes large-scale murals (15-20 ft) for campus beautification, where I led collaborative teams to blend aesthetics with functional public spaces. Professionally, as a DevOps engineer, I automated CI/CD pipelines and built home servers for media management and backups, sharpening my systems-thinking for scalable design.[](https://www.studential.com/personal-statement-examples/industrial-design-personal-statement)

Though my academic grades reflect a focus on practical application over theory, these experiences demonstrate my readiness for rigorous design education. The MA will advance my practice by integrating anthropological research methods and speculative design, enabling me to address social innovation and regenerative technologies.

Post-graduation, I envision contributing to R&D in product design firms or consultancies, creating accessible, tech-infused products that enhance daily life. This course will bridge my engineering foundations with strategic design expertise, positioning me to lead multidisciplinary teams in sustainable innovation. Central Saint Martins' global reputation and alumni network will accelerate this transition, fulfilling my exploratory journey into professional industrial design.[](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/apply/your-personal-statement)

I am an Electronics Engineer who is drawn to the intersection of technology and art. I am applying to the MSc. Creative Robotics course at UAL's Creative Computing Institute to learn the fusion of machine learning, computation, and creative applications.

My BE in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering provides to me, a foundation in embedded electronics, control systems and sensors. My interest in robotics

My BE in Electronics and Instrumentation provided foundational expertise in embedded systems, sensors, and control systems, aligning with core modules like Coding for Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Introduction to Machine Learning. I advanced these through hands-on projects: modifying Klipper firmware on my 3D printer to boost print speeds for custom TPU wearables that blend bespoke design, art, and technology; and building a DIY home theater with 3D-printed cabinets and Sigma Studio-programmable DSP for immersive audio processing using Python/C++ scripting. Complementing this technical practice, my large-scale murals and paintings cultivate a human-centered perspective, ready to inform embodied robotics drawing from philosophy, neuroscience, and ethics in units like Critical Robotics and Soft Robotics.[](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/postgraduate/msc-creative-robotics)

UAL's emphasis on creative mechanics (e.g., 3D printing robotic parts), ROS frameworks, and interdisciplinary research in Applied Robotics and Creative Making sets it apart from conventional engineering programs, offering the ethical, experimental space to evolve my work into interactive machines. Post-MSc, I envision R&D in creative robotics startups, developing social or performative robots for theatre, design industries, and beyond—leveraging UAL's alumni network in robotic engineering and creative technologist roles to turn concepts into reality.[](https://www.postgraduatestudentships.co.uk/masters-course/creative-robotics/56928)

This program will propel my shift from iterative engineering to innovative, art-infused robotics, addressing Industry 5.0 challenges through human-robot collaboration.[](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/postgraduate/msc-creative-robotics)
