### V 1
Product design's nature as a discipline that marries material science, manufacturing techniques and ergonomics in a complete package, excites me.   An institute like NID is the perfect seeding ground(?) for this process-driven, experimental approach. I intend to be someone at the forefront of 3D printed design and manufacture, leveraging its unique strengths alongside those of more exotic material. I also harbour entrepreneurial ambitions that align with my intentions. I am pursuing this currently, but I desire expert guidance and exposure that I can only find at NID.
I have experience working as a DevOps engineer, which has taught me to think big-picture of systems, automation and scalability. When I was gifted a 3D printer, a whole new world was opened up for me. I started off using the printer just as a tool to make trinkets, toys and later utility items using PLA. I later started printing using PETG and ABS, noting the different material properties and limitations. I started combining my training in electronics with my hobby to create a home theatre system for myself.  I took my first steps into entrepreneurship when I started making merchandise for my friend's coffee shop. I also learned of using TPU to make daily use objects and was blown away to learn that 3D printed shoes are being researched currently. Researching viable products, modelling, customizing and then printing them reliably and consistently exposed many of my current shortcomings with both theory and practice. I am using resources available to me through T-Hub in Hyderabad. In order to level up my knowledge of basic principles of design as well as materials and manufacturing, I should aim to learn at the best institute in India for this.
I am drawn to the culture of experimentation and iterative improvement at NID. Through the product design studios, material labs, and collaborative projects, I aim to explore how additive manufacturing can push the boundaries of human-centric design.
#### Issues:
Too much fluff. Meandering sentences. Too many complex sentences. No central story. Connection from who i am --> work/training as engineer --> ambition as designer not clear

### V 2
Product Design excites me as its a complete marriage of material science, manufacturing and human ergonomics. I see the M.Des from NID as the foundation for transitioning from a process-driven, iterative workflow to a complete design paradigm. My long term ambition is to push the boundaries of additive manufacturing in both design and material.
My experience as a DevOps engineer has trained me to think big-picture in terms of systems, automation and scalability. My experience with 3D printing has taught me prototyping, iteration and consumer-centric design. It has also helped me develop my entrepreneurial appetite.
