## How do you think this course will help your academic plans and/or career ambition? Not more than 1200 characters.

Product design's nature as a discipline that marries material science, manufacturing techniques and ergonomics in a complete package, excites me.   An institute like NID is the perfect seeding ground(?) for this process-driven, experimental approach. I intend to be someone at the forefront of 3D printed design and manufacture, leveraging its unique strengths alongside those of more exotic material. I also harbour entrepreneurial ambitions that align with my intentions. I am pursuing this currently, but I desire expert guidance and exposure that I can only find at NID.
